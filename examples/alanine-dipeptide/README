String method for alanine dipeptide with it's phi-psi angles

# Running the example
There is bash script, **run.sh**, for running it on a single machine, and a script **submit_beskow.sh** for running it in a slurm environment with MPI.

# Postprocessing
You find two python scripts for visualization and postprocessing: one for visualizing the strings and convergence,
and one for computing the free energy from the transitions.
The latter also provides a tool which handles the periodicity issue with dihedral angles by converting the dihadral angles to principal components with dihedral-PCA.

Note that these scripts require you to have matplotlib and scikit-learn installed.
